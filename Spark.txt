Apache Spark is a powerful open-source, distributed computing system that is designed for big data processing. It is built on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and provides a high-level API for data processing in various programming languages such as Java, Scala, and Python.
At the core of Spark is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD), which is a fault-tolerant collection of elements that can be processed in parallel. RDDs are immutable and partitioned, which allows Spark to efficiently process large datasets by distributing the data across a cluster of machines.
Spark also has a built-in scheduler called the Cluster Manager, which is responsible for allocating resources and managing the execution of tasks across the cluster. It supports various cluster managers like Standalone, Apache Mesos, Hadoop YARN, and Kubernetes.
In addition to its core RDD and Cluster Manager components, Spark also includes a number of libraries for specific data processing tasks such as SQL and DataFrames, Streaming, Machine Learning (MLlib), and GraphX. These libraries provide high-level APIs for performing complex data processing tasks and enable Spark to handle a wide range of use cases.
Spark also includes the Spark SQL module which provides a SQL like interface to perform SQL operations on structured data. Similarly, Spark Streaming module allows you to process real-time data streams. The MLlib module is used for Machine Learning and GraphX is used for graph computation.
In summary, Apache Spark is a highly efficient and versatile distributed computing system that makes it easy to process big data on a cluster of machines. Its RDDs, cluster manager, and libraries for SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing make it a powerful tool for a wide range of data processing tasks.
